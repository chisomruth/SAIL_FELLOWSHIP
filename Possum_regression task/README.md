# Introduction
In this work, we try to predict the head length of a possum from its different features. A possum is a creature which is a suborder of 70 tree-living marsupial species native to Australia and the Indonesian islands of New Guinea and Sulawesi.

We use this task as practice implementation of a Regression task in R
### The DATASET
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abrambeyer/openintro-possum). It consists of 14 columns and over 104 rows.
The possum dataset contains nine morphometric measurements for 104 mountain brushtail possums. These possums were captured at seven locations spanning Southern Victoria to central Queensland.
The different columns are:
- Case: The observation number
- Site: The site number where the possum was trapped.
- Pop: Population, either Vic (Victoria) or other (New South Wales or Queensland).
- Gender: Gender, either m (male) or f (female).
- Age: Age of the possum.
- hdlngth: Head length, in mm.
- skullw: Skull width, in mm.
- Totlngth: Total length, in cm.
- tail: Tail length, in cm.
- footlgth: foot length, in cm.
- earconch: ear conch length
- eye: distance from medial canthus to lateral canthus of right eye.
- chest: chest girth (in cm)
- belly: belly girth (in cm)

### Objectives:
In this project, we will conduct basic data cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics and then model building to try to predict the headlength from other features.

We shall specifically look at:
- Can we use the features to predict a possum's head length?
- What conclusions can we draw from our univariate, bivariate, or multivariate analysis and inferential statistics.
